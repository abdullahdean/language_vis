## Introduction

The goal of my final project is to apply algorithms on various language data sets and create a visualization to showcase my findings. By languages, I specifically mean the frequency data sets for languages, as in how frequently a word is used in one language relative to another. I would like to apply several algorithms on these data sets and potentially discover something new.
