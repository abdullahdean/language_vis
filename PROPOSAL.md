# Language Visualizations

## Introduction

The goal of my final project is to apply algorithms on various language data sets and create a visualization to showcase my findings. By languages, I specifically mean the frequency data sets for languages, as in how frequently a word is used in one language relative to another. I would like to apply several algorithms on these data sets and potentially discover something new.

## Libraries

I intend to use D3.js, Canvas.js, and Sigma.js for the project, which I think will be particularly helpful for the visualization aspect of this project.

## Objectives

I am particularly interested in the relationship a certain language has with another language, and their connection all other languages as a whole. I am not sure how many languages I will include but it should definitely be more than two. I have provided some goals for the grading portion of this assignment.

The project:

* creates and organizes relevant data sets from reliable sources
* applies an algorithm to the language data sets
* reaches a conclusion about the connection between various languages
* displays conclusion through some kind of visualization

I believe the preceding four bullet points were all accomplished.
